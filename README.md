# JS-Project-Forex-Data-Visualization

Background:
In this project, I will create an interactive data visualization platform for forex exchange rate data. The application will provide users with real-time and historical currency exchange rate information, enabling them to explore trends, fluctuations, and patterns in the forex market. Users will be able to select different currency pairs, customize timeframes, and add technical indicators to gain insights into the forex market's behavior. The visualization will aim to offer an intuitive and insightful experience for both forex traders and enthusiasts interested in understanding currency exchange trends.

Functionality & MVPs:
In the data visualization for forex, users will be able to:

View real-time and historical exchange rate data for various currency pairs.
Customize the chart's timeframe to analyze short-term or long-term trends.
Add technical indicators like moving averages or relative strength index (RSI) to enhance analysis.
Compare multiple currency pairs on the same chart for better correlation insights.
In addition, the project will include:

A landing page/modal with clear instructions on how to use the application.
A well-styled frontend for a pleasant user experience.
Option to mute or stop any background music or sounds.
Wireframes:
Here's a basic wireframe layout of the data visualization platform:

Technologies, Libraries, APIs:
The project will primarily use the following technologies and libraries:

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for frontend development.
charts.js for rendering interactive charts and data visualization.
An API for fetching real-time forex exchange rate data (I am not sure which yet).
Implementation Timeline:
Friday Afternoon & Weekend:

Set up the project repository and project structure.
Create the landing page/modal with clear instructions.
Fetch and display real-time exchange rate data using the chosen API.
Monday:

Implement chart rendering using chart.js with basic line chart functionality.
Allow users to customize the timeframe for the chart.
Tuesday:

Add functionality to compare multiple currency pairs on the same chart.
Integrate technical indicators (e.g., moving averages) into the chart.
Wednesday:

Polish the frontend design and ensure responsiveness.
Test the application for any bugs or issues.
Thursday Morning:

Finalize the project presentation and prepare for the demo.
Deploy the application to GitHub Pages.
Please note that the timeline is tentative and subject to adjustments as the project progresses. It allows for ample time to refine the visualization, add features, and handle any unforeseen challenges.
